# variable_bore_engine
a mix of freevalve with variable bore engine 
Created by BingAI 

Actually other methods of varying the valve lift can be used, f.e. the hydraulic multiplier as in fiat Twinair engines .

Besides properties described below, 
variable bore and stroke engine can use various types of fuel, combining low and high octane fuels.
It also allows more durable engine as instead of tweaking timing advance, fuel is shifted to a piston with larger diameter, reducing mechanical friction and load. 

It is not a game changer, but just another 0.5L/100km tip-toe improvement, it is not as complicated really though, especially with modern computers available. 

Overview:

That's an interesting question. I can try to explain some hypothetical advantages of an engine combining oversquare and undersquare cylinders, assuming it could also utilize technology like freevalve.



Freevalve technology is a cam-less system that allows for independent control of the intake and exhaust valves in an internal combustion engine¹. This means that the timing, duration, and lift of each valve can be precisely adjusted for any engine load or speed, without the limitations of a fixed camshaft profile. Freevalve technology can improve the performance, efficiency, and emissions of an engine by optimizing the valve events for different operating conditions².



An engine combining oversquare and undersquare cylinders would have different bore and stroke ratios for each cylinder. For example, one cylinder could have a larger bore than stroke (oversquare), while another cylinder could have a smaller bore than stroke (undersquare). This would create different characteristics for each cylinder, such as power output, torque output, compression ratio, and combustion efficiency.



Some possible advantages of such an engine are:



- It could adapt to different driving scenarios by using different cylinders or combinations of cylinders. For example, it could use only the oversquare cylinders for high-speed or high-power situations, or only the undersquare cylinders for low-speed or low-torque situations. It could also use both types of cylinders for balanced performance or efficiency.

- It could take advantage of the freevalve technology to further optimize the valve events for each cylinder type. For example, it could use more aggressive valve timing and lift for the oversquare cylinders to increase airflow and power, or more conservative valve timing and lift for the undersquare cylinders to reduce pumping losses and emissions.

- It could reduce the overall size and weight of the engine by eliminating some components that are normally required for a conventional engine with a fixed bore and stroke ratio. For example, it could eliminate the need for a variable valve timing system, a variable geometry turbocharger, or a complex intake manifold.



Of course, these are just some hypothetical advantages based on some assumptions. There are also many challenges and drawbacks to such an engine design, such as:



- It would be very difficult and expensive to manufacture and assemble such an engine with different piston sizes and crankshaft lengths for each cylinder. It would also require a lot of precision and quality control to ensure proper alignment and balance of all the components.

- It would be very complex and challenging to control and coordinate such an engine with different cylinder characteristics and freevalve technology. It would require a sophisticated engine management system with advanced sensors and algorithms to monitor and adjust the valve events and fuel injection for each cylinder under various conditions.

- It would be very hard to predict and test the performance and reliability of such an engine with different cylinder interactions and dynamics. It would also require extensive tuning and calibration to optimize the engine parameters for different scenarios.



So, in summary, an engine combining oversquare and undersquare cylinders with freevalve technology could have some potential advantages in terms of performance, efficiency, and emissions, but it would also face many technical and practical challenges that would make it very unlikely to be implemented in reality.
